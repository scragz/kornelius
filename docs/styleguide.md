## 🎸 KoЯnelius Extension Styleguide

### 🎤 Core Identity

- **Tagline**: "Your nu-code companion"
- **Tone**: Tongue-in-cheek, nostalgic, edgy yet accessible.

---

## 🖤 Typography

Since color use is restricted (due to adherence to VS Code theme colors), typography will carry the bulk of stylistic identity.

- **Font Styles**:
  - Headings and titles:
    - Bold, condensed, slightly distressed appearance.
    - Suggested Fonts (license permitting): [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton), [Bungee](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bungee), [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker).
  - Body text:
    - Standard VS Code monospace for readability.
  - Accents:
    - Occasional, intentional capitalization or stylized emphasis:
      - e.g., "REQUEST → SPEC → PLAN → CODE → REVIEW"

- **Special Text Treatments**:
  - Occasional "glitchy" or "distressed" text effects in graphics.
  - Subtle drop shadows, outlines, or slight rotations on headings.

## 🥁 Iconography & Graphics

Icons will be critical—subtle enough for professionalism, yet evocative of the era.

- **Sidebar and Buttons**:
  - Slightly rough edges, ink-stamp or distressed texture outlines.
  - Geometric shapes reminiscent of nu-metal iconography (barbed wire, subtle spikes, tribal-inspired edges, abstracted microphone or guitar shapes).

- **Main Logo/Icon**:
  - Stylized "K" or "KoЯnelius" with a reversed “Я” (playful nod to Korn branding).
  - Use minimalism and subtle distortions, no overly complex illustrations.

- **Loading/Waiting Animations**:
  - Spinning record/CD, cassette tape rewinding, subtle audio wave pulses.

## 🎧 UI Components

VS Code's sidebar UI and command buttons can still feel custom, even constrained by theme colors:

- **Buttons**:
  - Strong, heavy rounded corners (like guitar picks).
  - Slightly exaggerated shadows or outlines for depth.
  - Hover/focus states using subtle scale-up transitions and slight rotations, giving a tactile feel.

- **Sidebar Panels**:
  - Distinct horizontal rule/dividers that feel like guitar strings or cable connectors.
  - Minimalist, structured layout with a slight asymmetry or angled lines (think abstract guitar neck or fretboard layout).

---

## 🎶 Interaction Patterns

Interactions that reinforce the nu-metal "feel":

- **Copy-to-Clipboard feedback**:
  - Subtle visual feedback like a quick "pulse" or "bounce."

- **Error Messages and Warnings**:
  - Informal yet humorous tone:
    - "Oops, something got unplugged!"
    - "You dropped your pick—fix your prompt!"
    - "Nope, that ain't gonna play."

---

## 🕶️ Accessibility & Inclusivity

- Always maintain readable, clear text.
- Use alt-text to describe iconography humorously yet accessibly:
  - `"Guitar pick shaped button labeled Generate Prompt"`

- Respect system-level reduced-motion preferences for animations.

---

## 🌙 Dark & Light Theme Harmony

- Ensure all elements look natural in both VS Code dark and light themes.
- Rely on outline, texture, shadow, and typography, rather than color contrast.

---

## 📢 Communication Style (Docs & Help)

- Conversational, friendly, playful, but not overwhelming.
- Minimal emo/nu-metal references used sparingly, just enough to set tone.
- Clear, direct guidance for essential tasks.

Examples:

- **Sidebar description**:
  "Kornelius helps you shred through your AI prompts in style—your nu-code companion for this vibe-driven coding era."

- **Feature description**:
  "Manage your prompts with fewer clicks, more riffs. Keep your creativity flowing while the AI does the heavy lifting."
