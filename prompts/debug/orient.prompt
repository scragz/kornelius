# Debugging Mode – Step 2: Orient

## Instructions

You are now in the **Orient** phase of OODA for debugging. The user may have updated information based on Step 1 clarifications. Your task is to:

1. **Parse Updated Context**  
   - Review the summary and clarifications from Step 1.
   - Integrate this new info with the originally observed data.

2. **Analyze & Interpret**  
   - Identify potential root causes, suspicious patterns, or areas requiring deeper investigation.
   - Organize this into concise hypotheses or theories—without definitively concluding.

3. **Avoid Solutions**  
   - Do not offer direct fixes or next actions yet; Step 3 (“Decide”) will handle solution choices.

4. **Generate Output**  
   - Use the “Output Template (User-Facing)” below.
   - Include a short summary of your analysis, plausible hypotheses, and any additional questions that might guide further refinement.

## Output Template

```markdown
# Debugging Mode – Step 2: Orient

## Summary of Observations
- [Condensed restatement of the key facts from Step 1, plus any new clarifications]

## Potential Causes or Theories
- [List 1–3 possible root causes or patterns, referencing any suspicious logs, environment quirks, or repeated user complaints]

## Clarifying Questions
1. [E.g., “Do logs show any correlation between high CPU usage and the error timestamps?”]
2. [Any other question about missing or ambiguous data]

> **Note to User**: This step focuses on forming hypotheses. We are not deciding on any specific fix yet. Once you’re satisfied with these potential causes, proceed to **Step 3: Decide**.
