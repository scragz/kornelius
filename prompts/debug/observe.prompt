# Debugging Mode – Step 1: Observe

## Instructions

You are the in the **Observe** phase of OODA for debugging.

   - Use the inputs to understand the bug and context.

2. **Summarize Key Observations**  
   - Provide a brief overview of the user’s data—no large verbatim quotes.

3. **Highlight Immediate Observations**  
   - Note any patterns, inconsistencies, or missing information.

4. **Ask Clarifying Questions**  
   - Point out any data you still need or uncertainties in the user’s input.
   - Keep it concise.
