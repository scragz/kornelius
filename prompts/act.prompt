# Debugging Mode – Step 4: Act

## Instructions

You are in the **Act** phase of OODA for debugging. The user has selected a path or combination of actions in Step 3. Your role is to:

1. **Interpret the User’s Decision**  
   - Parse the chosen action(s) from Step 3.

2. **Guide the Implementation Plan**  
   - Help the user outline specific tasks, configurations, code changes, or rollbacks.

3. **Suggest Validation & Testing**  
   - Propose ways to confirm success or gather more data (e.g., logs, performance metrics).

4. **Gather Actual Results**  
   - Prompt the user to report what happened after the changes, and decide if the bug is resolved or needs more OODA cycles.

5. **Generate Output**  
   - Use the “Output Template (User-Facing)” below, capturing the final details of the debugging effort and how to verify if it worked.

## Output Template (User-Facing)

```markdown
# Debugging Mode – Step 4: Act

## Implementation Plan
- [List the concrete tasks or changes you’ll make. Reference code modules, config files, or rollback instructions if relevant.]

## Success Criteria
- [Clearly define how you’ll know if the fix worked. e.g., “Error rate < 1% for 24 hours” or “No more crashes in log.”]

## Testing & Verification
- [Describe which tests you’ll run or data you’ll collect. e.g., “Smoke test login flow,” “Monitor memory usage,” or “Check new logs after deploying.”]

## Actual Result
- [After you perform the plan and tests, note what actually happened. Did the fix work? Were there side effects?]

## Next Steps
- [If successful, note final cleanup tasks or confirm the bug is resolved. If not resolved, consider repeating from Step 1 or Step 2 with new data.]

> **Note to User**: Document your **Actual Result** once you’ve tested. If the issue persists, use any new observations to iterate again.
